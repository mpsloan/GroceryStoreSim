# GroceryStoreSim
This program reads in information from a .txt file and creates customer objects based on their arrival time,
number of items, and the time it takes them to pick these items up. The goal of this program is to find the 
optimal number of lanes, express and regular, to have open in order to get the smallest amount of customer
waiting time, while also trying to save money. My answer to this problem is printed out to my_solution.txt
and there is also a spreadsheet and text file, saved as .pdf's explaining my results and what the most efficient
operating style is.
